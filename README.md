 Stack Sequence Check (C Implementation)

 Problem Statement
You are given two integer sequences **pushed** and **popped**, both containing distinct values.  
Your task is to determine whether the sequence `popped` could have been the result of performing a series of **push** and **pop** operations on an initially empty stack using the order of elements in `pushed`.

- Return `1` (true) if the sequence is valid.
- Return `0` (false) otherwise.
